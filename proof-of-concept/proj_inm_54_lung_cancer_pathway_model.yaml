pathway: Lung cancer
version: 0.1

# A [pathway:] must have a name and a [version:]

# A pathway consists of multiple steps [steps:]

# There must be a start and an end step. Other steps must
# have a unique name 

# Each step consists of a name [name:], what it depends on [depends:]
# and what to do next [actions:]

# All actions [actions:] must also be a step.

# All actions [actions:] are any combination of:
# required [required:] (all), 
# optional [optional:] (0+ of many)
# optional exclusive [optional_exclusive:] (1 of many)
# or optional inclusive [optional_inclusive:] (1+ of many)

# ONE action type (required, optional, optional exclusive, or optional inclusive)
# MUST be chosen

# All dependencies must also be a step

# All dependencies [depends:] are any combination of:
# required [required:] (all), 
# optional [optional:] (0+ of many)
# optional exclusive [optional_exclusive:] (1 of many)
# or optional inclusive [optional_inclusive:] (1+ of many)

# ONE dependency type (required, optional, optional exclusive or optional inclusive)
# MUST be chosen

# Actions [actions:] occur (are initiated) only when the dependency [depends:]
# conditions are fulfilled.
